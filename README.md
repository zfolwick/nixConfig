# nixConfig
Linux Configuration files
Clone this into a folder `~/git/` and then run `sudo ./git/nixConfig/bashConfigure`, sit back, and enjoy.

You get: htop, tmux, vim, emacs24, silversearcher-ag (faster grep), docker, better bashrc with git integration, and some reasonable configurations for the above.  Additionally, this assumes Ubuntu, so it installs the much lighter weight metacity, and gnome-session-flashback, which will allow you to choose your desktop environment upon startup.

## Prerequisites
