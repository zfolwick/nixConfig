# nixConfig
Linux Configuration files

Run `sudo ./bashConfigure` from the `/nixSettings` folder, sit back, and enjoy.

You get: htop, tmux, vim, emacs24, silversearcher-ag (faster grep), an automatic update/upgrade package, better bashrc and git integration, and some reasonable configurations for the above.
